                may be deployed on when the traffic against it increases. If the requested
                value is too large, the deployment will error, but if deployment succeeds
                then the ability to scale the model to that many replicas is guaranteed
                (barring service outages). If traffic against the DeployedModel increases
                beyond what its replicas at maximum may handle, a portion of the traffic
                will be dropped. If this value is not provided, will use min_replica_count
                as the default value. The value of this field impacts the charge against
                Vertex CPU and GPU quotas. Specifically, you will be charged for max_replica_count
                * number of cores in the selected machine type) and (max_replica_count
                * number of GPUs per replica in the selected machine type).

                it may dynamically be deployed onto more replicas, and as traffic
                decreases, some of these extra replicas may be freed.
