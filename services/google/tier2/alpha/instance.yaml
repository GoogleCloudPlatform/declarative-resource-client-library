                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps
                                type URLs to message definitions as follows: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` (or the empty

                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps
                                type URLs to message definitions as follows: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` (or the empty

                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile

                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,

                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality

                          It is unique within a specific Tenancy Unit. CLH should
                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For
                          ex., if consumer network name is "my-network", a tag could
                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps
                                type URLs to message definitions as follows: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` (or the empty

                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps

                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` (or the empty

                          It is unique within a specific Tenancy Unit. CLH should
                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For
                          ex., if consumer network name is "my-network", a tag could
                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such

                                the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps
                                type URLs to message definitions as follows: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` (or the empty

                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile

                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use

                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps

                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` (or the empty

                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise

                          There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.
                        items:
                          properties:
                            typeUrl:
                              description: 'A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies
                                the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps
                                type URLs to message definitions as follows: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` (or the empty
                                scheme) might be used with implementation specific
                                semantics.'

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile

                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,

                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps
                                type URLs to message definitions as follows: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` (or the empty

                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps
                                type URLs to message definitions as follows: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` (or the empty
                                scheme) might be used with implementation specific
                                semantics.'

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps

                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to

                          It is unique within a specific Tenancy Unit. CLH should
                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For
                          ex., if consumer network name is "my-network", a tag could
                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps
                                type URLs to message definitions as follows: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` (or the empty

                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise

                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps
                                type URLs to message definitions as follows: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` (or the empty
                                scheme) might be used with implementation specific
                                semantics.'

                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise

                        is assumed. \\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a value
                        in binary format, or produce an error. \\\\\\* Applications
                        are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                        them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore,
                        binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types.
                        (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note:
                        this functionality is not currently available in the official
                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                        with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\`http\\\\\\`,
                        \\\\\\`https\\\\\\` (or the empty scheme) might be used with
                        implementation specific semantics.'

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps

                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps
                                type URLs to message definitions as follows: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` (or the empty

                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps

                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality

                          is used by Tenancy Units API to identify a tenant project.
                          It is unique within a specific Tenancy Unit. CLH should
                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For
                          ex., if consumer network name is "my-network", a tag could
                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`, or no scheme,
                                one can optionally set up a type server that maps
                                type URLs to message definitions as follows: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\*
                                If no scheme is provided, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET on the URL
                                must yield a value in binary format, or produce an
                                error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications are allowed
                                to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                                them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup.
                                Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to
                                manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\` (or the empty
                                scheme) might be used with implementation specific
                                semantics.'
