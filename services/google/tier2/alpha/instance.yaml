                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,

                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                                or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning

                                the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server
                                that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* If no scheme is provided,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET
                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                                or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`

                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,

                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile

                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use

                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,

                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality

                          It is unique within a specific Tenancy Unit. CLH should
                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For
                          ex., if consumer network name is "my-network", a tag could
                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server
                                that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* If no scheme is provided,

                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET
                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                                or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,

                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from

                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET
                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                                or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading

                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use

                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,

                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type

                          It is unique within a specific Tenancy Unit. CLH should
                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,

                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                                or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf

                                the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server
                                that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* If no scheme is provided,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET
                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                                or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,

                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use

                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or

                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,

                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,

                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                                or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning

                          There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

                              description: 'A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies
                                the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server
                                that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* If no scheme is provided,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET
                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                                or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`

                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,

                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,

                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                                or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning

                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from

                                the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server
                                that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* If no scheme is provided,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET
                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                                or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,

                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise

                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use

                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,

                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,
                          if service needs a tenant project per consumer network,
                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"
                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,

                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                                or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning

                          is requested, CCFE will check if a tenant project with such
                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                the type of the serialized protocol buffer message.
                                This string must contain at least one "/" character.
                                The last segment of the URL''s path must represent
                                the fully qualified name of the type (as in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`path/google.protobuf.Duration\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`).
                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                                into the binary all types that they expect it to use
                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
                                the scheme \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,
                                or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server
                                that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* If no scheme is provided,
                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET
                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                                or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,

                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise

                                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`https\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`
                                is assumed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* An HTTP GET
                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,
                                or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
                                is not currently available in the official protobuf
                                release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                                with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`http\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\`,

                          use a deterministic algorithm to generate a tag. For ex.,

                          consumer network name can be used to generate a tag. For

                          be "sn-my-network". Prefix "sn-" is used here, but CLH can
                          use any prefix they like as long as it does not change from
                          request to request. If a tenant project with tag "sn-my-network"

                          a tag already exists. If it does, CCFE will reuses it. Otherwise
                          CCFE will create a new tenant project.

                                The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                                "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile

                                in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use

                                on the URL must yield a value in binary format, or
                                produce an error. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\* Applications
                                are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL,

                                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be
                                preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type
                                names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality
