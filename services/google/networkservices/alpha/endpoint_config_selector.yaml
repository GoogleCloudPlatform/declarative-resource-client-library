            model where the proxy identifies itself as endpoint to the control plane,
            with the connection between sidecar and endpoint requiring authentication.

                    The metadata presented by the xDS client should contain all of
                    the labels specified here. The selection is determined based on
                    the best match. For example, suppose there are three EndpointConfigSelector
                    resources P1, P2 and P3 and if P1 has a the matcher as MATCH_ANY
                    , P2 has MATCH_ALL , and P3 has MATCH_ALL . If a client with label
