            Rules with the lowest priority are evaluated first. A default rule at
            priority Int32.MaxValue matches all IPv4 and IPv6 traffic when no previous
            rule matches. Only the action of this rule can be modified by the user.

        sourceRange:
          description: 'IP address or range, defined using CIDR notation, of requests
            that this rule applies to. You can use the wildcard character "*" to match
            all IPs equivalent to "0/0" and "::/0" together. Examples: `192.168.1.1`
            or `192.168.0.0/16` or `2001:db8::/32` or `2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
            Truncation will be silently performed on addresses which are not properly
            truncated. For example, `1.2.3.4/24` is accepted as the same address as
            `1.2.3.0/24`. Similarly, for IPv6, `2001:db8::1/32` is accepted as the
            same address as `2001:db8::/32`.'
