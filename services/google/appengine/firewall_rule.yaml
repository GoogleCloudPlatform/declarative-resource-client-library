            Rules with the lowest priority are evaluated first. A default rule at
            priority Int32.MaxValue matches all IPv4 and IPv6 traffic when no previous
            rule matches. Only the action of this rule can be modified by the user.

            that this rule applies to. You can use the wildcard character "*" to match
            all IPs equivalent to "0/0" and "::/0" together. Examples: `192.168.1.1`
            or `192.168.0.0/16` or `2001:db8::/32` or `2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
            Truncation will be silently performed on addresses which are not properly
            truncated. For example, `1.2.3.4/24` is accepted as the same address as
            `1.2.3.0/24`. Similarly, for IPv6, `2001:db8::1/32` is accepted as the
            same address as `2001:db8::/32`.'
