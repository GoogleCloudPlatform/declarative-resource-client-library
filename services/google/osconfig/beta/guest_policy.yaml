          description: Specifies the VMs that are assigned this policy. This allows
            you to target sets or groups of VMs by different parameters such as labels,
            names, OS, or zones. Empty assignments will target ALL VMs underneath
            this policy. Conflict Management Policies that exist higher up in the
            resource hierarchy (closer to the Org) will override those lower down
            if there is a conflict. At the same level in the resource hierarchy (ie.
            within a project), the service will prevent the creation of multiple policies
            that conflict with each other. If there are multiple policies that specify
            the same config (eg. package, software recipe, repository, etc.), the
            service will ensure that no VM could potentially receive instructions
            from both policies. To create multiple policies that specify different
            versions of a package or different configs for different Operating Systems,
            each policy must be mutually exclusive in their targeting according to
            labels, OS, or other criteria. Different configs are identified for conflicts
            in different ways. Packages are identified by their name and the package
            manager(s) they target. Package repositories are identified by their unique
            id where applicable. Some package managers don't have a unique identifier
            for repositories and where that's the case, no uniqueness is validated
            by the service. Note that if OS Inventory is disabled, a VM will not be
            assigned a policy that targets by OS because the service will see this
            VM's OS as unknown.
