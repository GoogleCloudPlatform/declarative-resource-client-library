            A list of conditions for the policy. The conditions are combined by AND or

            to true, then an incident is created. A policy can have from one to six
            conditions.

                      well as how to combine the retrieved time series together (such as
                      when aggregating multiple streams on each resource to a single
                      stream for each resource or when aggregating streams across all
                      members of a group of resrouces). Multiple aggregations
                      are applied in the order specified.

                      This field is similar to the one in the [`ListTimeSeries`
                      request](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/projects.timeSeries/list).
                      It is advisable to use the `ListTimeSeries` method when debugging this
                      field.

                            The `alignment_period` specifies a time interval, in seconds, that is used
                            to divide the data in all the
                            [time series][google.monitoring.v3.TimeSeries] into consistent blocks of
                            time. This will be done before the per-series aligner can be applied to
                            the data.

                            The value must be at least 60 seconds. If a per-series aligner other than
                            `ALIGN_NONE` is specified, this field is required or an error is returned.
                            If no per-series aligner is specified, or the aligner `ALIGN_NONE` is
                            specified, then this field is ignored.

                            The reduction operation to be used to combine time series into a single
                            time series, where the value of each data point in the resulting series is
                            a function of all the already aligned values in the input time series.

                            Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid
                            choices depend on the `metric_kind` and the `value_type` of the original
                            time series. Reduction can yield a time series with a different
                            `metric_kind` or `value_type` than the input time series.

                            Time series data must first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`) in order
                            to perform cross-time series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is
                            specified, then `per_series_aligner` must be specified, and must not be
                            `ALIGN_NONE`. An `alignment_period` must also be specified; otherwise, an
                            error is returned.

                            specified. The `group_by_fields` determine how the time series are
                            partitioned into subsets prior to applying the aggregation
                            operation. Each subset contains time series that have the same
                            value for each of the grouping fields. Each individual time
                            series is a member of exactly one subset. The
                            `cross_series_reducer` is applied to each subset of time series.
                            It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so
                            this field implicitly contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
                            specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated away.  If

                            alignments cause all the data points in an `alignment_period` to be
                            mathematically grouped together, resulting in a single data point for
                            each `alignment_period` with end timestamp at the end of the period.

                            The `alignment_period` specifies a time interval, in seconds, that is used

                            Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid

                            It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so

                            The `alignment_period` specifies a time interval, in seconds, that is used
                            to divide the data in all the

                            a function of all the already aligned values in the input time series.

                            Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid

                            `metric_kind` or `value_type` than the input time series.

                            Time series data must first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`) in order
                            to perform cross-time series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is

                            operation. Each subset contains time series that have the same

                            It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so

                      When computing ratios, the `aggregations` and

                            Not all reducer operations can be applied to all time series. The valid

                            `metric_kind` or `value_type` than the input time series.

                            Time series data must first be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`) in order
                            to perform cross-time series reduction. If `cross_series_reducer` is

                            It is not possible to reduce across different resource types, so

                      `filter` field will be used as the numerator.

                      The filter must specify the metric type and optionally may contain
                      restrictions on resource type, resource labels, and metric labels.

                      seconds--are supported. If an invalid value is given, an
                      error will be returned. When choosing a duration, it is useful to

                      (which may also be affected by any alignments specified in the
                      `aggregations` field); a good duration is long enough so that a single
                      outlier does not generate spurious alerts, but short enough that
                      unhealthy states are detected and alerted on quickly.

                  Required if the condition exists. The unique resource name for this

                      projects/[PROJECT_ID_OR_NUMBER]/alertPolicies/[POLICY_ID]/conditions/[CONDITION_ID]

                  `[CONDITION_ID]` is assigned by Stackdriver Monitoring when the
                  condition is created as part of a new or updated alerting policy.

                  When calling the
                  [alertPolicies.create][google.monitoring.v3.AlertPolicyService.CreateAlertPolicy]
                  method, do not include the `name` field in the conditions of the
                  requested alerting policy. Stackdriver Monitoring creates the
                  condition identifiers and includes them in the new policy.

                  When calling the
                  [alertPolicies.update][google.monitoring.v3.AlertPolicyService.UpdateAlertPolicy]
                  method to update a policy, including a condition `name` causes the
                  existing condition to be updated. Conditions without names are added to
                  the updated policy. Existing conditions are deleted if they are not
                  updated.

                  Best practice is to preserve `[CONDITION_ID]` if you make only small
                  changes, such as those to condition thresholds, durations, or trigger
                  values.  Otherwise, treat the change as a new condition and let the
                  existing condition be deleted.

                    description: |-
                      A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
                      protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in
                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][google.protobuf.Type]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
                      type.googleapis.com.

                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
                      used with implementation specific semantics.
