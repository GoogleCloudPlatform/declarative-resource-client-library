          description: An optional human-readable description of this notification
            channel. This description may provide additional details, beyond the display
            name, for the channel. This may not exceed 1024 Unicode characters.

        displayName:
          description: An optional human-readable name for this notification channel.
            It is recommended that you specify a non-empty and unique name in order
            to make it easier to identify the channels in your project, though this
            is not enforced. The display name is limited to 512 Unicode characters.

          default: true
          description: Whether notifications are forwarded to the described channel.
            This makes it possible to disable delivery of notifications to a particular
            channel without removing the channel from all alerting policies that reference
            the channel. This is a more convenient approach when the change is temporary
            and you want to receive notifications from the same set of alerting policies
            on the channel at some point in the future.

            The permissible and required labels are specified in the \[NotificationChannelDescriptor.labels\]\[google.monitoring.v3.NotificationChannelDescriptor.labels\]
            of the \`NotificationChannelDescriptor\` corresponding to the \`type\`
            field.

            to the corresponding \`NotificationChannelDescriptor\`'s schema, unlike
            the \`labels\` field. This field is intended to be used for orv3nizing
            and identifying the \`NotificationChannel\` objects. The field can contain
            up to 64 entries. Each key and value is limited to 63 Unicode characters
            or 128 bytes, whichever is smaller. Labels and values can contain only
            lowercase letters, numerals, underscores, and dashes. Keys must begin
            with a letter.

        verificationStatus:

            or \[\`GetNotificationChannel\`\]\[google.monitoring.v3.NotificationChannelService.GetNotificationChannel\]
            operation, this field is expected to be populated. If the value is \`UNVERIFIED\`,
            then it indicates that the channel is non-functioning (it both requires
            verification and lacks verification); otherwise, it is assumed that the
            channel works. If the channel is neither \`VERIFIED\` nor \`UNVERIFIED\`,
            it implies that the channel is of a type that does not require verification
            or that this specific channel has been exempted from verification because
            it was created prior to verification being required for channels of this
            type. This field cannot be modified using a standard \[\`UpdateNotificationChannel\`\]\[google.monitoring.v3.NotificationChannelService.UpdateNotificationChannel\]
            operation. To change the value of this field, you must call \[\`VerifyNotificationChannel\`\]\[google.monitoring.v3.NotificationChannelService.VerifyNotificationChannel\].
