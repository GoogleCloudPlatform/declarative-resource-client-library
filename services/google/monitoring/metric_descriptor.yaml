        unit:

          description: The units in which the metric value is reported. It is only
            applicable if the `value_type` is `INT64`, `DOUBLE`, or `DISTRIBUTION`.
            The `unit` defines the representation of the stored metric values. Different
            systems may scale the values to be more easily displayed (so a value of
            `0.02KBy` _might_ be displayed as `20By`, and a value of `3523KBy` _might_
            be displayed as `3.5MBy`). However, if the `unit` is `KBy`, then the value
            of the metric is always in thousands of bytes, no matter how it may be
            displayed.. If you want a custom metric to record the exact number of
            CPU-seconds used by a job, you can create an `INT64 CUMULATIVE` metric
            whose `unit` is `s{CPU}` (or equivalently `1s{CPU}` or just `s`). If the
            job uses 12,005 CPU-seconds, then the value is written as `12005`. Alternatively,
            if you want a custom metric to record data in a more granular way, you
            can create a `DOUBLE CUMULATIVE` metric whose `unit` is `ks{CPU}`, and
            then write the value `12.005` (which is `12005/1000`), or use `Kis{CPU}`
            and write `11.723` (which is `12005/1024`). The supported units are a
            subset of (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) of 1,
            such as in `1/s`. It is typically used when none of the basic units are
            appropriate. For example, "new users per day" can be represented as `1/d`
            or `{new-users}/d` (and a metric value `5` would mean "5 new users). Alternatively,
            "thousands of page views per day" would be represented as `1000/d` or
            `k1/d` or `k{page_views}/d` (and a metric value of `5.3` would mean "5300
            page views per day"). * `%` represents dimensionless value of 1/100, and
            annotates values giving a percentage (so the metric values are typically
            in the range of 0..100, and a metric value `3` means "3 percent"). * `10^2.%`
            indicates a metric contains a ratio, typically in the range 0..1, that
            will be multiplied by 100 and displayed as a percentage (so a metric value
            `0.03` means "3 percent").
