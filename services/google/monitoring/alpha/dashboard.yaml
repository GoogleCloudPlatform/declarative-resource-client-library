                                less than or equal to 10 would put the scorecard in
                                a DANGER state, values greater than 10 but less than

                                            The `group_by_fields` determine how the

                                            prior to applying the aggregation operation.
                                            Each subset contains time series that
                                            have the same value for each of the grouping
                                            fields. Each individual time series is
                                            a member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`

                                            contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
                                            specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated
                                            away.  If `group_by_fields` is not specified
                                            and all the time series have the same
                                            resource type, then the time series are
                                            aggregated into a single output time series.

                                            this field is ignored.

                                            The `group_by_fields` determine how the

                                            Each subset contains time series that
                                            have the same value for each of the grouping
                                            fields. Each individual time series is
                                            a member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`

                                            and all the time series have the same

                                            when `cross_series_reducer` is specified.
                                            The `group_by_fields` determine how the
                                            time series are partitioned into subsets
                                            prior to applying the aggregation operation.
                                            Each subset contains time series that
                                            have the same value for each of the grouping
                                            fields. Each individual time series is
                                            a member of exactly one subset. The `cross_series_reducer`
                                            is applied to each subset of time series.
                                            It is not possible to reduce across different
                                            resource types, so this field implicitly
                                            contains `resource.type`.  Fields not
                                            specified in `group_by_fields` are aggregated
                                            away.  If `group_by_fields` is not specified
                                            and all the time series have the same
                                            resource type, then the time series are
                                            aggregated into a single output time series.
                                            If `cross_series_reducer` is not defined,
                                            this field is ignored.

                                            all the data points in an `alignment_period`
                                            to be mathematically grouped together,
                                            resulting in a single data point for each
                                            `alignment_period` with end timestamp

                                            series. The valid choices depend on the
                                            `metric_kind` and `value_type` of the
                                            original time series. Alignment can change
                                            the `metric_kind` or the `value_type`
                                            of the time series.  Time series data
                                            must be aligned in order to perform cross-time

                                                  the resulting series is a function
                                                  of all the already aligned values
                                                  in the input time series.  Not all
                                                  reducer operations can be applied
                                                  to all time series. The valid choices
                                                  depend on the `metric_kind` and
                                                  the `value_type` of the original
                                                  time series. Reduction can yield
                                                  a time series with a different `metric_kind`
                                                  or `value_type` than the input time
                                                  series.  Time series data must first
                                                  be aligned (see `per_series_aligner`)

                            Except for `ALIGN_NONE`, all alignments cause all the

                            to all time series. The valid choices depend on the `metric_kind`
                            and `value_type` of the original time series. Alignment
