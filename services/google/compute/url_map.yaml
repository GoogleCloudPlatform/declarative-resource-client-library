    DefaultRouteAction:
      description: |-
        `defaultRouteAction` takes effect when none of the `pathRule`s or `routeRule`s match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions like URL rewrites, header transformations, etc. prior to forwarding the request to the selected backend. If `defaultRouteAction` specifies any `weightedBackendService`s, `defaultService` must not be set. Conversely if `defaultService` is set, `defaultRouteAction` cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.

        Only one of `defaultRouteAction` or `defaultUrlRedirect` must be set.

                              Opaque filter criteria used by Loadbalancer to restrict routing configuration to a limited set of [xDS](https://github.com/envoyproxy/data-plane-api/blob/master/XDS_PROTOCOL.md) compliant clients. In their xDS requests to Loadbalancer, xDS clients present [node metadata](https://github.com/envoyproxy/data-plane-api/search?q=%22message+Node%22+in%3A%2Fenvoy%2Fapi%2Fv2%2Fcore%2Fbase.proto&). If a match takes place, the relevant routing configuration is made available to those proxies.

                              For each `metadataFilter` in this list, if its `filterMatchCriteria` is set to MATCH\_ANY, at least one of the `filterLabel`s must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its `filterMatchCriteria` is set to MATCH\_ALL, then all of its `filterLabel`s must match with corresponding labels provided in the metadata.

                              `metadataFilters` specified here will be applied after those specified in `ForwardingRule` that refers to the `UrlMap` this ``HttpRouteRuleMatch `belongs to.` ``

                              ``` `` `metadataFilters` only applies to Loadbalancers that have their`` loadBalancingScheme``` set to `INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED`.

                        For `routeRules` within a given `pathMatcher`, priority determines the order in which load balancer will interpret `routeRules`. `RouteRules` are evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The priority of a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The first rule that matches the request is applied.

                        You cannot configure two or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority for each rule must be set to a number between 0 and 2147483647 inclusive.

                        Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in the future without affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of priority numbers to which you could add rules numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any impact on existing rules.
