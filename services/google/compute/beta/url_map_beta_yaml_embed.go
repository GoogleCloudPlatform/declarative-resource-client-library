As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by Loadbalancer on a percentage of requests before sending those request to the backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the Loadbalancer for a percentage of requests.\n\n                            `timeout` and `retry_policy` will be ignored by clients that are configured with a `fault_injection_policy`.\n                          properties:\n                            abort:\n                              type: object\n                              x-dcl-go-name: Abort\n                              x-dcl-go-type: UrlMapPathMatcherPathRuleRouteActionFaultInjectionPolicyAbort\n                              description: The specification for how client requests\n                                are aborted as part of fault injection.\n                              properties:\n                                httpStatus:\n                                  type: integer\n                                  format: int64\n                                  x-dcl-go-name: HttpStatus\n                                  description: |-\n                                    The HTTP status code used to abort the request.\n\n                                    The value must be between 200 and 599 inclusive.\n                                percentage:\n                                  type: number\n                                  format: double\n                                  x-dcl-go-name: Percentage\n                                  description: |-\n                                    The percentage of traffic (connections/operations/requests) which will be aborted as part of fault injection.\n\n                                    The value must be between 0.0 and 100.0 inclusive.\n                            delay:\n                              type: object\n                              x-dcl-go-name: Delay\n                              x-dcl-go-type: UrlMapPathMatcherPathRuleRouteActionFaultInjectionPolicyDelay\n                              description: The specification for how client requests\n                                are delayed as part of fault injection, before being\n                                sent to a backend service.\n                              properties:\n                                fixedDelay:\n                                  type: object\n                                  x-dcl-go-name: FixedDelay\n                                  x-dcl-go-type: UrlMapPathMatcherPathRuleRouteActionFaultInjectionPolicyDelayFixedDelay\n                                  description: Specifies the value of the fixed delay\n                                    interval.\n                                  properties:\n                                    nanos:\n                                      type: integer\n                                      format: int64\n                                      x-dcl-go-name: Nanos\n                                      description: Span of time that's a fraction\n                                        of a second at nanosecond resolution.
