            field is properly set to a value between \[0, 1\]. `backupPool` and `failoverRatio`
            together define the fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the
            ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below `failoverRatio`,
            traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup
            pool. In case where `failoverRatio` and `backupPool` are not set, or all
            the instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed
            back to the primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread
            to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when
            no instance is healthy.'

            all times. Only HttpHealthChecks are supported. Only one health check
            may be specified.

            expression \`\[a-z\](\[-a-z0-9\]\*\[a-z0-9\])?\` which means the first
            character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
            be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
            cannot be a dash.
