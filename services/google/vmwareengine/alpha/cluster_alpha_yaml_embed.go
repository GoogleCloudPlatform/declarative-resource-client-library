The empty string is a\n            valid value. Labels are set on creation and updated like any other field.\n            Specifically, to add a new label, you would need to provide all of the\n            existing labels along with the new label. If you only provide a map with\n            the new label, all of the old labels will be removed (probably not what\n            is desired).\n        location:\n          type: string\n          x-dcl-go-name: Location\n          description: The location for the resource\n          x-kubernetes-immutable: true\n        management:\n          type: boolean\n          x-dcl-go-name: Management\n          readOnly: true\n          description: Output only.
