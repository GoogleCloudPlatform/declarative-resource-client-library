This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is\n                requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The\n                resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists,\n                and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the\n                finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items,\n                deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not\n                be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or\n                the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may\n                request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by\n                sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After\n                that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL)\n                to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the\n                presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this\n                timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the\n                resource is fully terminated.\n                If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.\n\n                Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.\n                Read-only.\n                More info:\n                https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata\n              properties:\n                nanos:\n                  type: integer\n                  format: int64\n                  x-dcl-go-name: Nanos\n                  readOnly: true\n                  description: |-\n                    Non-negative fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution.
