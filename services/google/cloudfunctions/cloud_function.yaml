            backward compatibility, if function with given name is not found, then the
            system will try to use function named "function".

            in `source_location`.

          properties:
            eventType:
              description: |-
                Required. The type of event to observe. For example:
                `providers/cloud.storage/eventTypes/object.change` and
                `providers/cloud.pubsub/eventTypes/topic.publish`.

                Event types match pattern `providers/*/eventTypes/*.*`.
                The pattern contains:

                1. namespace: For example, `cloud.storage` and
                   `google.firebase.analytics`.
                2. resource type: The type of resource on which event occurs. For
                   example, the Google Cloud Storage API includes the type `object`.
                3. action: The action that generates the event. For example, action for
                   a Google Cloud Storage Object is 'change'.
                These parts are lower case.

            resource:
              description: |-
                Required. The resource(s) from which to observe events, for example,
                `projects/_/buckets/myBucket`.

                Not all syntactically correct values are accepted by all services. For
                example:

                1. The authorization model must support it. Google Cloud Functions
                   only allows EventTriggers to be deployed that observe resources in the
                   same project as the `CloudFunction`.
                2. The resource type must match the pattern expected for an
                   `event_type`. For example, an `EventTrigger` that has an
                   `event_type` of "google.pubsub.topic.publish" should have a resource
                   that matches Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.

                Additionally, some services may support short names when creating an
                `EventTrigger`. These will always be returned in the normalized "long"
                format.

                See each *service's* documentation for supported formats.
