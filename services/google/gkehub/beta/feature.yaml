                            the type of the serialized protocol buffer message. This
                            string must contain at least one "/" character. The last
                            segment of the URL''s path must represent the fully qualified
                            name of the type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`).
                            The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading
                            "." is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile
                            into the binary all types that they expect it to use in
                            the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme
                            `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set
                            up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions
                            as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
                            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a value in binary
                            format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed
                            to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them
                            precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore,
                            binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes
                            to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking
                            changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently available
                            in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for
                            type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes
                            other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                            be used with implementation specific semantics.'
