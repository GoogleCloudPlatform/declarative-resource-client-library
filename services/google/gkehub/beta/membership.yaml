                If set, then Google will allow valid OIDC tokens from this issuer
                to authenticate within the workload_identity_pool. OIDC discovery
                will be performed on this URI to validate tokens from the issuer.
                Clearing `issuer` disables Workload Identity. `issuer` cannot be directly
                modified; it must be cleared (and Workload Identity disabled) before
