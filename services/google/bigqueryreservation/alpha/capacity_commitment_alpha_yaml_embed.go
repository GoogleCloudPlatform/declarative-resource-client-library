However, for\n                      URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one\n                      can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message\n                      definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https`\n                      is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type\n                      value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications\n                      are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have\n                      them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore,\n                      binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types.\n                      (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.)
