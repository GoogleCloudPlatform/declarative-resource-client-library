                      type of the serialized protocol buffer message. This string
                      must contain at least one "/" character. The last segment of
                      the URL''s path must represent the fully qualified name of the
                      type (as in `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should
                      be in a canonical form (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).
                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
                      that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                      URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one
                      can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message
                      definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https`
                      is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a google.protobuf.Type
                      value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications
                      are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have
                      them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore,
                      binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types.
                      (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note:
                      this functionality is not currently available in the official
                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                      with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than `http`, `https`
                      (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific
                      semantics.'
