            regular Service Perimeter.  In addition to being in a regular service
            perimeter, a resource can also be in zero or more perimeter bridges. A

            is done through analyzing the differences between currently enforced and
            suggested restrictions. useExplicitDryRunSpec must be set to True if any
            of the fields in the spec are set to non-default values.
