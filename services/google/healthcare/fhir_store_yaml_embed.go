Each\n            store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config\n            is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in\n            addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list,\n            the server stops streaming to that location. Some lag (typically on the\n            order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in\n            the streaming destination.\n          x-dcl-send-empty: true\n          x-dcl-list-type: list\n          items:\n            type: object\n            x-dcl-go-type: FhirStoreStreamConfigs\n            properties:\n              bigqueryDestination:\n                type: object\n                x-dcl-go-name: BigqueryDestination\n                x-dcl-go-type: FhirStoreStreamConfigsBigqueryDestination\n                description: The destination BigQuery structure that contains both\n                  the dataset location and corresponding schema config. The output\n                  is organized in one table per resource type. The server reuses the\n                  existing tables (if any) that are named after the resource types.\n                  For example, \"Patient\", \"Observation\". When there is no existing\n                  table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one.\n                  When a table schema doesn't align with the schema config, either\n                  because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible\n                  modification, the server does not stream in new data. BigQuery imposes\n                  a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource\n                  mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data is not streamed.\n                  One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table\n                  and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table\n                  only contains data after the table recreation. Results are written\n                  to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition.\n                  Different versions of the same resource are distinguishable by the\n                  meta.versionId and meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE)\n                  that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The\n                  tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming\n                  was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one\n                  view per table of the same name containing only the current resource\n                  version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed\n                  to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId\n                  columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare\n                  cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL\n                  select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an\n                  id and meta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view\n                  mentioned above also filters out duplicates. If a resource mutation\n                  cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors are logged to Cloud Logging.\n                  For more information, see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).\n                properties:\n                  datasetUri:\n                    type: string\n                    x-dcl-go-name: DatasetUri\n                    description: BigQuery URI to an existing dataset, up to 2000 characters\n                      long, in the format `bq://projectId.bqDatasetId`.\n                  schemaConfig:\n                    type: object\n                    x-dcl-go-name: SchemaConfig\n                    x-dcl-go-type: FhirStoreStreamConfigsBigqueryDestinationSchemaConfig\n                    description: The configuration for the exported BigQuery schema.\n                    properties:\n                      recursiveStructureDepth:\n                        type: integer\n                        format: int64\n                        x-dcl-go-name: RecursiveStructureDepth\n                        description: The depth for all recursive structures in the\n                          output analytics schema.
