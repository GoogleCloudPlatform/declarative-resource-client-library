              description: The [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/) topic
                that notifications of changes are published on. Supplied by the client.
                PubsubMessage.Data contains the resource name. PubsubMessage.MessageId
                is the ID of this message. It is guaranteed to be unique within the
                topic. PubsubMessage.PublishTime is the time at which the message
                was published. Notifications are only sent if the topic is non-empty.
                [Topic names](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview#names)
                must be scoped to a project. Cloud Healthcare API service account
                must have publisher permissions on the given Pub/Sub topic. Not having
                adequate permissions causes the calls that send notifications to fail.
                If a notification can't be published to Pub/Sub, errors are logged
                to Cloud Logging (see [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging)).
                If the number of errors exceeds a certain rate, some aren't submitted.
                Note that not all operations trigger notifications, see [Configuring
                Pub/Sub notifications](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/pubsub)
                for specific details.
